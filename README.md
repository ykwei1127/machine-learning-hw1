# Machine Learning 2021 Homework 1

## Question
1. Use line equation y=mx+b with particular parameters m and b to generate 30 2D data samples. 15 samples are in the right of the line are marked as positive samples and the others are in the left as negative samples. No samples on the line.
2. Implement Perceptron Learning Algorithm with your own initial w. Discuss if your PLA halts or how many iterations it halts. Generate the data samples three times and calculate the average number of iterations when PLA halts.
3. In Problem 1, generating 1000 positive samples and 1000 negative samples. Implement Pocket Algorithm and compare the execution time to PLA on the same dataset.

## Run code
- utils.py is used to generate sample points and visualize answer
- q2.py and q3.py complete the requirements of the questions. q2.py doesn't calculate the average numbers of iteration when PLA halts. We should calculate it by execute three times manually.

```
python q1.py
```
```
python q2.py
```
```
python q3.py
```
